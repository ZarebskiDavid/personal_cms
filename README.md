# Installation

## Development version

You'll need a [Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). The easiest way to run the app with the dev server and a populated Maria database is to: 

**Clone the repo**

```
git clone https://github.com/zar3bski/personal_cms
cd personal_cms
```
and run 

```
docker-compose up -d
```
Have then a look at `localhost:8000`

## Production version

default test credentials `john` : `478951236a`
